# How to Join on Console

## <mark style="color:blue;">PlayStation</mark>

• Download the **BedrockTogether** app on mobile for IOS or Google Play. If Bedrock together doesn't work, you can try a paid app called MC Lan Proxy.

• Start the BedrockTogether app, where you will see "Connect" and an area to enter the IP and Port for your server. Your mobile device must be on the same network as your console.

• Enter the following into these fields:

* Server address: torrentsmp.com
* Port (leave default): 19132

• Then click the "Run" button to start the app. It'll work to route the connection to your Xbox or Playstation

• Open Minecraft on your console and navigate to the "Friends" tab, then locate the LAN section. The server will be displayed here

• You can now select the server to begin connecting. Once you're connected, you can then close the BedrockTogether app

Add PlayTorrent as a friend on Xbox. He is ALWAYS running a session of the server. You can simply join his game from your friend's list.

## <mark style="color:red;">Nintendo Switch</mark>

• On the home screen, navigate to "System Settings"

• Navigate to "Internet"

• Click "Internet Settings" and select your current network under "Registered Networks"

• Locate the DNS Settings option and select "Manual"

• Select the Primary DNS option and set the value to 173.82.100.84 if you’re in the US,&#x20;

• Select the Secondary DNS option and enter 1.1.1.1

• Click "Save"

• Open your Minecraft application and click "Play" from the main menu

• Afterward, head towards the "Servers" tab and join any featured one displayed

• Once in-game, click "Connect to a Server" from the new menu that appeared

• Enter the IP and port of the Torrent Network

• Click the Add to Server List option and press "Submit" to begin playing on the server.

## Notes

• Changing your DNS settings will work on Playstation or Xbox as well. Depending on the user’s preferences, it may be easier to just make a one time change to your DNS settings. Third party apps are known not to work for Switch.

• On Windows and mobile devices, you don’t need third party apps nor do you need to change DNS settings. Simply click add server and type in the IP like normal.
