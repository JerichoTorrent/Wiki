# Mail & Private Messaging

## Mail

To send mail to a player, make sure you have an empty hand and then type `/mail new`. This will open up a book that you can use to write your mail. You can write your full message here and then click "sign". Write a title for your mail then click "sign and close". Your mail is now saved and you can send it to anyone. If you don't click "sign" and just click "done," your mail will be saved as a draft.\
\
To send the mail, type `/mail send <player>` (without the brackets) and the mail will be sent down the Torrent Datastream to another player, even if he is not online. This is an excellent option if you want to write a long email to a player that won't fit in a chat message, or if the player is offline.\

There is a known issue in which this system does not work on Bedrock edition. You can still use the old mail system by typing `/mail send <player> <message>`.

## Private Messaging

Using your typical commands like `/tell`, `/msg`, and `/pm`, you can send players private messages while both of you are online. The full string is `/pm <player> <message>`. To easily reply, type `/r <message>`. You will hear a pop once you receive a private message, and it will show up in the chat with a red prefix telling you who sent it.

You can also privately message someone simply by clicking on their name in chat.
