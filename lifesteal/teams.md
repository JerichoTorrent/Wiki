# Teams

A team, as the name implies, is a group of players collaborating with each other. There are team leaderboards to show which team is the most powerful. Writing a question mark (?) before your message only sends your message in team chat. Check the [commands](../commands.md) page for team-related commands. A team can be allied with each another team, or can be mortal enemies. You cannot kill other players in your team, but can leave or disband the team at any time.\
\
To create a team, type `/team create <name>` and invite a player with `/team invite <player>`\
\
Teams allow you to join forces with other players to get to the top of the leaderboard, for a chance to win team-related prizes and team PvP events. Be careful! You never know when one of your team members will betray you by gaining your trust. Always keep your head on a swivel on the Lifesteal server. It's the ones you trust the most that will stab you in the back.
