# Artorian Axe Style

Artorian Axe Style is the art of hacking your opponent with an axe. The ancient Artorian masters preferred great battle axes imbued with dark magic, but any axe will do. You can gain XP in Artorian Axe Style by defeating mobs and players with an axe. You can gain the natural effect of knockback and activate a bloodlust implant known as Berserker's Rage. You can also use this skill to break down your opponent's armor with gravitational magic.

## Gravity Well

This ability is an AoE attack similar to sweeping edge, but for axes. Your gravity magic will deal damage to other mobs/players besides your main target. You deal half the damage to other mobs that you dealt to the main target.

## Berserker's Rage

Activating your bloodlust implant allows your adrenaline output to spike, causing you to deal critical damage. Every 2 levels in this skill increases the chance of going Berserk by 0.1%. The skill causes 2x damage to mobs and 1.5x damage to other players.

## Artorian Axe Mastery

Master the ancient arts of the Artorian axe masters. This is a passive ability that will add additional damage to your axe swings. The bonus damage increases by 1 every 50 levels, up to a cap of 4 extra damage at level 200.

## Shatter Weakness

This ability has a passive chance to damage armor by overloading the output of your forearm implants. As you level up Artorian Axe Style, the damage will increase.

## Gravity Blast

This is the ultimate application of gravity magic. You have a 25% chance of applying Knockback II to your opponent, as well as additional damage, when using axes to fight.
