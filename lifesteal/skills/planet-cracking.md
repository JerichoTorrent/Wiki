## Plasma Cutter <a href="#how-to-use-super-breaker" id="how-to-use-super-breaker"></a>

With a pickaxe in your hand, right click to ready your tool. Once in this state, you have about 4 seconds to make contact with Mining compatible materials, which will activate Plasma Cutter. This ability has a cooldown tied to the **Planet Cracking** skill. It triples your chance of extra items dropping and enables instant break on **Planet Cracking** materials, if you have a higher end pickaxe. With a crummy pick, this compares to haste.

## Supernova <a href="#how-to-use-blast-mining" id="how-to-use-blast-mining"></a>

With a pickaxe in hand, crouch and right-click on TNT from a distance. This will cause the TNT to instantly explode. Super Nova is an ability with a cooldown tied to the **Planet Cracking** skill. It gives bonuses when mining with TNT and allows you to remote detonate TNT. There are three parts to Super  Nova:&#x20;

## Nuclear Fusion

Increases the blast radius of Supernova. Levels up with your **Planet Cracking** skill.

## Nuclear Physicist

Decreases damage that YOU take from TNT explosions. This uses your knowledge of atomic energy to upgrade your implants to shield against the blast.

## Matter Synthesizer

The third part simply increases the amount of ores dropped from TNT and decreases the debris dropped.
