# Forester

XP is gained whenever you break log blocks.

## Lumberer <a href="#how-does-tree-feller-work" id="how-does-tree-feller-work"></a>

This is an active ability. You can right-click while holding an axe to activate Lumberer. This will cause the entire tree to break instantly, dropping all of its logs at once.

## Roaring Winds <a href="#how-does-leaf-blower-work" id="how-does-leaf-blower-work"></a>

Activate your cyberforce to cause leaf blocks to break instantly when hit with an axe. This ability unlocks at level 100.

## Master Lumberer <a href="#how-do-double-drops-work" id="how-do-double-drops-work"></a>

This passive ability gives you a chance to obtain an extra block for every log you chop.
