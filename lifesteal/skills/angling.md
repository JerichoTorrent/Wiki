# Angling

Become a more efficient, successful fishing expert with Angling. Gain XP by catching fish.

## Artificer

Level Requirement: 10

This ability allows you to find treasure from fishing with a small chance of the items being enchanted. Every possible treasure for Angling has a chance to drop on any level. The rarity of the item determines how often it will drop. The higher your Angling skill is, the better your chances are to find better treasures. It is paired with **Soul Hunter** to also give enchanted items.

Each treasure is organized into one of six categories, the same as [Loot Chests](../structures/loot-chests.md), increasing in tier:

* Common
* Uncommon
* Rare
* Epic
* Legendary
* Mythic

Your level dictates your percentage chance of getting any of the specified types of items. The higher your level, the higher your chance of rarer items.

## Tundra Angling <a href="#ice-fishing" id="ice-fishing"></a>

This passive skill allows you to fish in ice lakes! Cast your fishing rod in an ice lake and the ability will create a small hole in the ice to fish in. Pull once to melt through the ice. The hook will remain in the newly melted water.

## Catch Master <a href="#master-angler" id="master-angler"></a>

Level Requirement: 15

This passive skill increases the bite chance while fishing. When you've unlocked this ability, fishing while in a boat improves odds of catching a fish.

## Shakedown <a href="#shake" id="shake"></a>

Level Requirement: 15

This active ability allows you to shake items loose from [Bosses](../bosses.md) by hooking them with the fishing rod. Mobs will drop items they would normally drop on death. It is also possible to acquire mob skulls, which are normally much more difficult to obtain in survival mode.

Shakedown items off of mobs or players with your fishing pole.

On mobs this will damage them for 1/4 of their total health. This has an upper limit of 10 damage. This means that a Boss with over 40 health (20 hearts) will at most have 5 hearts removed every shakedown.
