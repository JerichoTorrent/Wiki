# Implant Techniques

XP is gained based on the amount of damage dealt to mobs or other players when unarmed.

## Artorian Plight <a href="#how-does-berserk-work" id="how-does-berserk-work"></a>

Artorian Plight is an active ability that is activated by right-clicking. While in Artorian Plight mode, you deal 50% more damage and you can break weak materials instantly, such as Dirt and Grass.

## Metal Plating <a href="#how-does-steel-arm-style-work" id="how-does-steel-arm-style-work"></a>

Increase the metallic plating in your cybernetic forearm implants. This increases the damage dealt when hitting mobs or players with your fists.

## Magnetic Field <a href="#how-does-arrow-deflect-work" id="how-does-arrow-deflect-work"></a>

This is a passive ability that gives you a chance to deflect arrows shot by Skeletons or other players. By emanating a magnetic field around yourself, the arrow will fall harmlessly to the ground.

## Biometric Strain <a href="#how-does-iron-grip-work" id="how-does-iron-grip-work"></a>

This is a passive ability that has a chance to counter cyberforce. As your unarmed level increases, the chance of preventing cyberforce increases.

## Cyberforce <a href="#how-does-disarm-work" id="how-does-disarm-work"></a>

Combine direct Soul Affinity attacks with your implants, causing the target's equipped item to fall to the ground.

## Frequency Vibrations

Will be updated later.
