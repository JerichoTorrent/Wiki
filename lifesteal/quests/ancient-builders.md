Mari Curian will tell you of her research into the Ancient Builders and the civilizations of the past. She will need you to collect samples from an Ancient City. Finding the City is on you, but there are several nearby spawn, such as at X: 191 | Y: -34 | Z: 928

Walk up to the portal frame in the center and click on any of the blocks to collect the samples.
