# Voting

Typing `/vote` will pull up a menu of voting sites that our network is listed on. Simply select a voting site and it will send you the link in chat. Click the link and it will pull up in your default browser. Once there, type your in-game-name as it appears on Minecraft and click vote. If done correctly, you will see your balance go up by $250 per voting site. You will also earn a voting point for each vote. If you're on Bedrock, remember to include the dot (.)\
\
You can spend your voting points in `/voteshop`. Currently, you can exchange voting points for the following rewards:



| Server             | Reward          | Cost              |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Survival/Lifesteal | Diamond         | 3 Voting Points   |
| Survival/Lifesteal | $10,000         | 10 Voting Points  |
| Survival/Lifesteal | Mending Book    | 50 Voting Points  |
| Lifesteal          | Gem             | 50 Voting Points  |

## Vote Party

Every time the server reaches 100 votes, we have a party! This _only_ applies to players that have voted during the length of the party. When the vote party is reached, all players receive the following rewards:

* 10 vote keys
* 1 legendary key
* $10,000
* 5 diamonds
* 2 gems (Lifesteal and SkyFactions only)
