# Discord

The Torrent Network Discord is the quintessential location for all in-game events, information, and chatting from all around the world. We post pictures of our builds and plans. We also just goof off and talk to ChatGPT and several other AI bots we have. The Discord is a lively community, so you should join even if you don't spend much time on the Minecraft servers. There are a ton of cool people in there that pop in and out.

Most discussions take place in #general, but people often pop into #minecraft-chat, where the chat is linked with all of the Minecraft servers simultaneously.

## AI Bots

You can talk to any of the AI bots in our Discord server by just pinging them and typing your message. However, only #off-topic and #bot-commands are where you can actually speak to them, to prevent spammy behavior. ChatGPT will actually automatically respond to some messages in these channels. You can also use `/imagine` to use our stable diffusion bots to generate AI images. By default, the images are 1:1 aspect ratio. We have several models you can pick from. Please don't spam these, because we have limited API calls each month. Lastly, the Torrent Master is a custom trained version of Mee6 that knows about the lore of the Network.

## Showcase

The showcase channels have been extremely misused in the past, but I think we've found a good balance now. #community-projects is for posting projects that the Torrent community is all involved with. #individual-projects is for posting projects that you yourself are working on alone. You can post pictures, plans, and information about any of your builds or ideas. However, make sure they're actually about or built on Torrent Network. Don't just use this as a place to advertise your social media or another server. Self-promotion is not cool.

## Events

We have events periodically that are posted both in the default Discord events tab at the very top left of the server, and #events. These events are anything from [Alien Invasions](lore/) to building events, or just a new project that is launching. If you don't join the Discord, you miss these events. Anyone can submit an event for approval in #create-a-ticket, which if approved, will be posted in this channel.

## Canned Responses

The Torrent Canned Responses system makes it easy to respond quickly to a frequently asked question. Prepend an exclamation point (`!`) to a valid tag to call for a canned response. Here is the current taglist: advertising, ask, bingo, claims, cracked, donate, elytras, evading, faq, giybf, join, map, mods, nohello, offline, online, paper, restart, shops, versions, vote, website, wiki.
