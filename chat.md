# Chat

Our chat system is connected on all servers. It is formatted with your rank followed by your message. To ping a player so he hears an in-game notification sound, type `@<player name>`. By hovering over different parts of the chat, you can get more information about individual players, click to privately message, and more.

## **Channels**

On the network you can join one of 3 channels: server-specific (hub, survival, creative, skyfactions, or lifesteal) , global, or ranged. By default you will join the global channel automatically, but will join the other two channels in read mode. You can use `/channel` or `/ch` to select another channel to read or write in. Upon joining the creative or hardcore server you will automatically join those channels in read mode. You can also use `/channel` to leave a channel you don't want to read or write in.

If you want to leave a channel, do `/ch leave <channel>`.

## **Discord**

You can join our Discord server by typing `/discord` which will send you a link in chat. Once joined, you will be taken to the #server-rules channel. Go back to the Minecraft server and type `/discord link` if you wish to link your Discord account with your Minecraft account. This will allow you to send messages as your in-game player name from Discord. We often have important announcements, events, and community-building things that you will miss out on if you don't join the discord.

## Emojis

To use emojis, you can type `/emoji` or just type `:` and press "tab" to pull up the emojis options. You can select from the list and click tab again to complete it. There are also hidden unicode emojis! Find them :smile:

## **Chat Colors and Tags**

If you purchase a rank on our server, you will get access to varying levels of chat colors and formatting, as well as tags. Tags, otherwise known as nicks, are your way of changing your identity on the server with one command. Simply type `/nick <name>` to change your nick/tag. To open the color menu, simply type `/chc color menu`.

## Server Assistant AI

We do have some quirks with our chat that helps keep things less spammy and make sure people get heard. First of all, we have an AI chatbot currently set up on Lifesteal and Survival that will automatically detect questions from players. It is trained to detect when it's a legitimate question and not just players talking amongst each other. It is very knowledgeable about the servers and should _usually_ answer your question correctly. For example, if you ask "how do I get back to spawn?" the assistant should answer something along the lines of "you can use `/spawn` or use an access point."

I go through and retrain the AI periodically if it says anything wrong or lacks a response for something it should answer. Special thanks to Kaludi for letting me use this amazing system!

## Chat Filter

Yes, we have a chat filter. Womp womp. We occasionally have had family friendly streamers on the server. They have a right to not have their audience see bad language, and we want them on our Network. Also, we are officially partnered with Minehut, so we have to have a chat filter. Don't try and "beat" the chat filter, or you'll get muted. I would appreciate if people could just _try_ and be not toxic in the chat when I need them to behave, but there's not much one can do about that.

## More Features

By holding an item in your hand and typing `[item]`, you can display the item in a hoverable message that shows its properties. This can show the item's name, enchantments, attack damage, etc.

By typing `[pos]`, it will display your current coordinates in chat, bypassing the need to manually input them. This is great for asking for help or meeting up with other players.

You can post clickable links in chat, simply include the https protocol of the URL (`https://`) in your message. This is heavily moderated! Do not post unsafe links or advertise other services.

By typing `!` before your message, it will automatically send the message to the team chat, no matter which channel you are currently in.

Chat games coming soon!
