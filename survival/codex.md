## Categories

As you explore the world, complete quests, raid dungeons, and pass certain thresholds of progression, more and more of the codex will be revealed. Think of the codex as your player's journal. Some of it may be written in first person, and some of it will include primary source lore bits you discover from entering certain regions or encountering certain mobs. The codex is split into 5 categories.

### World History

As you enter key locations, complete quests, and meet NPCs, you will uncover the history of Torrent SMP which will be displayed here. This could include lore about the regions you discover, events that took place on the server, and more.

### Regions

Each major region on the server has a codex entry associated with it. Think of this as your character summarizing the lore and primary source documents you find in the region, combined with that with which the rumor mill uncovers.

### Monsters

Every time you encounter a new custom monster, a codex entry will be revealed to you about the monster. This includes its drops, strengths and weaknesses, and health. You can use these entries tactically to plan your strategy against monsters of this type.

### NPCs

Each NPC you meet has their own backstory and goals. As you continue to do quests and meet NPCs, more and more of the codex will be discovered. Some NPCs have relationships with others, and your relationships with these NPCs will change over time. Make sure to check their codex entries before making difficult decisions, as the psychology and backstory of these characters are important.

### Quests

The quest menu, `/quest`, summarizes dialogue and quest descriptions. This section of the codex is more like your personal quest log. This will go into detail about each quest and the characters you met along the way, written completely in first person.
