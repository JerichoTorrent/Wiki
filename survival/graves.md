# Graves

So you died. First of all, breathe. On the survival server, we have a grave system that saves your items, in the exact slots you had them in, inside of a grave with a copy of your playerhead in its place. Your death coordinates will be posted for you to see in chat. Head back that way and break the grave. Your items will be returned to you in the slots you had them in. If you picked up items along the way, some items may drop on the floor as they can't be returned in the slots.\
\
If you died in claimed land and can't break your grave, don't panic. Simply stand within 10 blocks and type `/claimgrave`. If you lost your grave or it got buried in chat, type `/graves` and the location of any of your graves will be revealed to you. If by chance this doesn't work, make a ticket in discord. Be careful; this isn't a foolproof system. Your grave will automatically break after 24 hours and the items will spill out onto the ground, pursuant to the vanilla despawn timer.\
\
You can only make 10 graves until your oldest graves start breaking. Another quirk is that if you die in the exact same spot over and over, your graves can stack absurdly high. You may think this system is a bit non-vanilla and I hear you, but it was brought about by community input and has been a great addition to our server.
