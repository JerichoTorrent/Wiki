# Teleportation Hub

In the Teleportation Hub, located in a prismarine building on the main road near 0/0, you will find teleporters (portals) to every major district on the server. Once a district is fully established and ready to offer a unique POI to explore, make a portal there, and a return portal to the hub. Also located in the hub are a few unique systems:\
\- A portal that randomly teleports you between 1,000 and 5,000 blocks away\
\- An NPC named "Teleportation Master" who facilitates TPA requests to other players. Upon clicking him it will open up a menu and give you temporary permission to send TPA requests to any player you click on. They will have 120 seconds to accept it\
\- A portal that takes you back to the location of your bed, AKA your spawn point\
