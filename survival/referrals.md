# Referrals

When you refer a player to the SMP, cash in your reward! Here's how it goes:

* On the SMP, use the command `/referral create`. Click on your code to copy it.
* Send the code to your friend, either in-game with `/pm <player>` or externally.
* Have your friend run this command: `/referral redeem <your code goes here>`
* You and your friend have both earned $5,000! You can check your referral codes with `/referral list`.

Do keep in mind that these referral codes are currently on the SMP only, referral codes for other servers are coming soon.
