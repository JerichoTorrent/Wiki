# Dungeons and Taverns

This datapack alone offers so much for the server and player base to explore. This feature adds 100 new structures across all dimensions including new structures and trials in the End and Nether. Also, this datapack expands on the new Tricky Trials Update, including boss mobs and a dozen different Trial Chambers with exclusive Keys specific to each different trial. Examples include the Trident Boss Trial Key and The End Castle Trial Key to name a few. This data packs adds vanilla-like structures that are supposed to blend in with the rest of the game and feel like they belong there.

Going from environmental additions like Fire Watch Towers and Taverns to Dungeons, like the Badland Miner Outpost and Illager Hideout. You can view photos of the structures [here](https://modrinth.com/datapack/dungeons-and-taverns/gallery).

## Structures

## How to Find Them

To find these structures and new enchantments, find new 1.21 chunks in the world. These new chunks have a chance to spawn these structures just like normal structure generation.

Note: This datapack is currently added to Survival, but this will be added to Lifesteal once we update to 1.21.
