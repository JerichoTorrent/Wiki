# Greasing the Gears

Head out of the City Hall and take a right, down the stairs. You will come across this building:

Head inside and turn left. There you will find Thrash, drinking himself into a stupor as always. Talk to Thrash to complete the quest. Click on him again to start the quest "Sent From Above."
