# Return

Return to the Clockwork City town square to speak with Numinar. If you don't remember how to get there, head straight from the Upgate Station and past the Clockwork City Radius. Watch out for fabricants and other mobs on your way there. Continue until you get to the piston bolt network and go left.

Go straight from the piston bolt, past the teleportation array, and into the oxidized copper building at the end: City Hall. Numinar is on the 2nd floor. Exact coordinates: `17075 / 3 / 4764`.

Talk with Numinar to complete the quest. Click on him again to start the quest "More Questions."
