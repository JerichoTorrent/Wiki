# To the City

Talk to Terra Nova and he will collect your materials from you (not really, but just imagine.) He will inform you that the teleportation array is up and running. Simply turn around and walk straight underneath the structure before you. It will then teleport you to Clockwork City. Don't be fooled, this is only the beginning of your journey.

Continue forward to talk to the Precursor, another factotum built by the infamous Tinkerer. Talk to him to start the quest "Far from Home."
