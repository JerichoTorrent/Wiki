# Hermit's Request

Terra Nova's old friend, the Tinkerer, seems to be up to no good. In order to breach his effective defenses, Terra Nova informs you that you need a stronger method of teleportation than they have available. To get their machine up and running, you will need to gather 15 amethyst shards. How you go about doing that is up to you. Maybe you will want to check the shopping district?

If you get lost, you can find Terra Nova again by heading due Southwest from coordinates `0/0`. Return to Terra Nova and give him the amethyst. He will inform you of his compatriot, Drath, who has departed to the Enderlands while Terra Nova was waiting for your return. The Enderlands is easy to find, but the Outpost is not necessarily hiding in plain sight. Return to spawn or head due North from Trident Town. Heading further Northwest will take you to the Outpost. The approximate coordinates of the entrance are `56 / 89 / -3009`.
