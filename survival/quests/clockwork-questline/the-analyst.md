# The Analyst

The Analyst will not reveal his information for free. He will require a diamond as payment for his knowledge, simple may it be. Go and find a diamond. Buy it, trade it, mine it; whatever you have to do. Come back once you have it and give it to the Analyst.

Once you've gathered the necessary information about the Tinkerer, head back to Numinar. He is still going to be in the City Hall in the Clockwork City town square. Talk to Numinar to complete the quest.

Talk to Numinar again to start a short quest "World Fracture."
