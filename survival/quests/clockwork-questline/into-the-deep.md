# Into the Deep

After speaking with Masscroft and getting slandered, head deeper into the Redstone Labs. There you will find the scientist's notes in a lectern. Click on them and read them quickly, as the Upgate Station will receive your return signal within 10 seconds. The exact coordinates of the notes are `-1331 / -50 / 1174`. Once the return signal is received, you will be teleported back to the Upgate Station.

Speak with Alice once more to start the quest "Return."
