# Survival

Head back to Terra Nova to start this quest. If you forgot his location, he is still at `-2035 / 69 / 1562`. Talk to him to complete this quest. This may be a long journey so you can cut it in half by running `/spawn`. You can then head to the closest structure to those coordinates in the [Teleportation Hub](../../teleportation-hub/).

Click on Terra Nova again to start the next quest, To the City.
