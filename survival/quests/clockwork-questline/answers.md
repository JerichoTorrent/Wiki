Talk to the CCS to start the quest. The CCS will scan you to determine your threat level, which is moderate. Set your spawn in the nearby bed at once. It will deploy defenses that you need to fight against to finally find the answers you seek. Head West (straight) and you will fight several factotums. As you continue to fight through the factotums you will eventually find the questline's main boss: the Imperfect. This is a TOUGH fight. It is recommended you take golden apples and netherite armor to the fight, or you may get demolished.

After defeating the Imperfect and the many factotums, continue heading West and you will eventually find the tinkerer's fragment. He will give you the best bit of lore in the form of dialogue in the entire story. Pay close attention to his words. Once complete, he will give you an epic final reward and send you back to Spawn Academy.

Congratulations! You have completed the Clockwork Questline! Thank you for playing. I hope you had an amazing time. Special thanks to Kiokugames for writing and implementing these quests.
