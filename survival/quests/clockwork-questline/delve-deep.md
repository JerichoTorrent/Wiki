# Delve Deep

Click on the factotum prototype again to start this quest. He will boot up into maintenance mode and fail a diagnostic check, returning to a sleep state awaiting a power source. You can reboot him by gathering more blaze rods (5.) If you kept the extra blaze rods you got from Old Clockwork City, you can complete this quest quickly. If not, you may need to head back to get more, or find them in the nether. Once you reboot the factotum prototype he will start playing a cryptic log for you.

The log will play regailing you of a story about interdimensional travel, and mentions a certain space station. Specifically, it tells you about a rift to the core of the multiverse and a key to which that lies in the Kemel-Ze laboratory. The prototype will go back into sleep mode, requiring you to turn on the system's main power source deeper in Kemel-Ze. Go to `56 / 64 / -3122` and flip the lever to turn on the main system power. Be careful! Not all of the factotums are friendly automatons.

Head back to Drath to complete the quest, up the ladder and to the right. Click through his dialogue to start the quest "Survival."
