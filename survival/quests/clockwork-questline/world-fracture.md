# World Fracture

This quest is quite short. Head back, yet again, into the Clockwork City Radius. Dodge and weave the fabricants and head inside the Upgate Station. You should know where it is right now. If you don't, refer to [What's Up Gate?](whats-up-gate.md) Go inside the Station and talk to Alice and tell her of your discoveries. This will complete the quest.
