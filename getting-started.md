# Getting Started

The number one question any player joining the network will have is "what do I do?" The answer is really up to the player. This network recognizes two camps of players: those that wish to just play on their own and get to know the community and systems later, and those that wish to jump into the immersive gameplay the server offers. When a player joins Torrent, they will spawn in the hub. Use the server selector or the portals to switch your server. You can also use `/server survival`, `/server creative` or `/server lifesteal`.

**The Vanilla Experience**

For the players that wish to simply experience the vanilla-like gameplay Torrent offers, you can instantly get started at Spawn Academy. One portal randomly teleports you between 1,000 and 5,000 blocks away, while the other portal teleports the player to our **Teleportation Hub:** a unique network of portals that leads to every major district on the server. Don't worry, no matter which option you choose, you will be able to easily come back with `/spawn`. Another option is to use the portal to the Ax√©l Village to build near other players.\
\
**Getting Immersed**\
\
Some players itch for new content, so we try to add unique features based on community input. In lieu of "seasons," we have "expansions," in an effort to never reset the world but not run out of content. There are lots of ways to get started, but I recommend first making a starter base; either using the random teleporter or finding a spot in or near a village, partnering up with others, or just venturing out on your own. Once your starter base is complete, it might behoove you to make some money using our [Economy](survival/economy.md) guide.\
\
Whichever way you want to play on the server, I would highly recommend exploring it first. Start with exploring spawn, clicking on all the NPCs, and learning what commands you can run. A great way to explore the server is by traveling to the [Teleportation Hub](broken-reference) and going through each portal. There will be a return portal nearby. Alternatively, you can activate the [quest](survival/quests/) "Travelin' Torrent."

## <mark style="color:green;">**Creative**</mark>

On the creative server, you will spawn into the world and see plots as far as the eye can see. To get started, simply find an unclaimed plot and type `/plot claim`. This wiki will be updated with guides on flags and commands once it's been set up properly. You can use `/plot home` to get back to your plot if you leave, and `/plot trust <player>` in order to give players access to build in your plot.\
\
Note: due to exploits and attempted crashes (mainly from Minehut players) this server requires you to purchase a rank or creative plot in our [webstore](https://torrent.tebex.io), or play on the other servers for a significant amount of time to earn a plot.

## <mark style="color:red;">**Lifesteal**</mark>

This server is a real challenge. If you die, you lose a heart, but you can kill a player to gain a heart. If you die and lose all your hearts, you are death banned for 1 day and will respawn with 5 hearts. You can also craft hearts. If you're eliminated, you can be revived with a revive crystal. This server has custom items, skills, advanced enchantments, a custom honor and reputation system, and much more.\
\
It is highly recommended to NOT accept any TPA requests to avoid getting trapped and killed by other players. It is instead advised to gear up, engage with our custom mechanics like fishing, and gain power on the server. Farming XP and opening crates, as well as adding advanced enchants to your gear, will significantly increase your power level. Overall, simply playing on the server to level up your skills, abilities, and gear, will greatly increase your chances of succeeding in PvP. However, nothing can account for pure skill. So get good!
