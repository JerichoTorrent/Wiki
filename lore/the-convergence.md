# The Convergence

Eons before the current era, a society known as the Ancient Builders ruled over Torrent. They lived in a feudal society, and a city lost to time flourished under King Jericho. This society practiced an ancient magic known as [Soul Affinity](soul-affinity.md). Jericho saw the great power in Soul Affinity and used it to open a portal to another realm: the Slate Dimension.\
\
The Slate Dimension is a strange, alien realm. Many worlds exist within the Slate Dimension, including the world of Haven. Havenites have a rich history, from ancient magic users to modern engineers and blacksmiths. The Havenites were the first to come through the portal, since the portal that appeared on their end was just out of the greater orbit of their world. A few months after its opening, the first Haven Vanguard came through the other side for an expedition.

Haven technology is a mix between artifacts of ancient magic, mostly lost to time, and the marvels of their modern engineering. They used this event as an opportunity to learn about Soul Affinity to discover the secrets of their own history. Among them was an outworlder known as Roth. Roth and King Jericho formed a partnership, and shared technology, language, and culture amongst each other.\
\
Eventually, another society became aware of the portal orbiting Haven: the Artorians. Their leader Artorius Prime was a tyrannical emperor. He is the very same character to later invade Torrent 14,000 years after the Convergence, during the [Alien Invasion](./#alien-invasion) event of Torrent Survival.
