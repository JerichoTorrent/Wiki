# Soul Affinity

Soul Affinity is an aspect of ancient dark magic that led to the current state of affairs on Torrent. \~14,000 years ago, the Ancient Builders used dark magic excessively, experimenting with astral projection, frequency vibrational technology, and portal technology. These portals eventually led to the portal storm known as [The Convergence](the-convergence.md). Through those portals came the Artorians, as well as many other races from the Slate Dimension.

Soul Affinity has many applications, namely in our [skill tree](../lifesteal/skills/). Your player character has cybernetic implants, the origins of which are unknown. These implants can be activated with Soul Affinity, which takes time, effort, and knowlege to upgrade. Through leveling up your skills, you learn applications of Soul Affinity that allow you to use your cyberware at full potential. In Season 2 of Lifesteal, Soul Affinity will be a major gameplay element beyond just PvP and PvE, but will actually determine where you can go and how far your ambition takes you, including new custom dimensions.
