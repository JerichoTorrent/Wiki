# Islands

From the SkyFactions Hub, you can easily create your island by clicking the Island Creator NPC or by typing `/island create`. A menu will pull up asking you to confirm the creation of your island; click yes.

From there, you will instantly teleport to your island. In front of you, you will see the Obelisk, a custom administration node for your island. More on that later in these docs. To delete your island, type `/island delete` and then `/island delete confirm`. This action cannot be undone.

To trust a friend to visit your island, type `/island trust <player>` and they can visit it with `/island visit <player>`. They will not be able to break blocks or access containers on your island. To collaborate on an island together, you need to start or join a faction.

If you screw up the cobblestone generator, or make some other mistake along the way that cripples your progress, worry not! There are many ways to advance your island and get the items you need. You can trade with other players, complete quests, gather those items on a faction island, or purchase crate keys. The sky world is your oyster!
