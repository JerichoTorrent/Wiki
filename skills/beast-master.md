# Beast Master

To gain XP in this skill, you need to tame wolves/ocelots and get into combat with your wolves. Simply taming the animals won't net you XP.

## Spirit Summon <a href="#how-does-call-of-the-wild-work" id="how-does-call-of-the-wild-work"></a>

Spirit Summon is an active ability that will allow you to summon a wolf or an ocelot by your side. You can do this by sneaking + left-clicking while holding bones or fish.

## Werecall <a href="#how-does-beast-lore-work" id="how-does-beast-lore-work"></a>

Werecall allows players to inspect pets and to check the stats of wolves and ocelots. Left-click a wolf or ocelot to use Werecall.

## Bloody Talon <a href="#how-does-gore-work" id="how-does-gore-work"></a>

Bloody Talon is a passive ability that has a chance of inflicting a bleeding effect on your wolves' targets.

## Call of the Hound <a href="#how-does-sharpened-claws-work" id="how-does-sharpened-claws-work"></a>

This provides a damage bonus to damage dealt by wolves. The damage bonus depends on your **Beast Master** level.

## Proprioception <a href="#how-does-environmentally-aware-work" id="how-does-environmentally-aware-work"></a>

This passive ability will allow wolves to teleport to you when they get near hazards, such as Cacti/Lava. It will also give wolves fall damage immunity.

This passive ability will reduce damage and make wolves fire resistant.

## Searing Skin <a href="#how-does-shock-proof-work" id="how-does-shock-proof-work"></a>

This passive ability reduces damage done to wolves from explosions.

## Druid's Call <a href="#how-does-fast-food-service-work" id="how-does-fast-food-service-work"></a>

This passive ability gives wolves a chance to heal whenever they perform an attack.
