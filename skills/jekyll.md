# Jekyll

Upon shooting players and mobs with your bow and arrow, you will level up Jekyll. There is a damage boost that scales with your level and the integrated skill to mesmerize your enemy during PvP. You can also retrieve some of your spent arrows after defeating an opponent. You gain XP by shooting and killing an enemy, be it mob or player.

## Artorius Vision

By activating your ocular implant, you do additional damage with your arrow shots. The bonus damage increases as your Jekyll skill levels up. Your bonus damage increases 10% every 50 levels, up to a 200% maximum.

## Mesmerize

By mesmerizing your opponent with your ocular powers (kind of like genjutsu in Naruto) you cause your opponent to look straight upward for a short time. A mesmerizing shot also deals an additional 4 damage (2 hearts worth with no armor toughness.)

## Ammo Recombination

By applying Soul Affinity to your spent arrows, you can recombine them back into your quiver. This is a passive ability, and only activates upon killing an enemy with your bow. The chance of this ability activating increases as you level up your Jekyll skill. This ability increases by 0.1% per level, up to 100% at level 1000.
