# Antiquarian

Your Soul Affinity can be used for more than just PvP. You can find epic, ancient treasures underneath the land of Torrent. With Antiquarian, you will find more treasures the more you level up your skill. By digging up certain materials with a shovel, you will level up.

Compatible Materials: Grass, Dirt, Sand, Clay, Gravel, Mycelium, Soul Sand, Snow

## Pulverizer

You have an implant in your hand that can connect to a shovel via Bluetooth. This implant turns your shovel into a Pulverizer, but requires Soul Affinity to activate. This effect triples your chance of finding ancient treasures and can also insta-mine compatible Antiquarian materials.

## Archaeology

Every possible treasure for Antiquarian has its own skill level requirement for it to drop, as a result it's difficult to say how much it is helping you. Just keep in mind that the higher your Antiquarian skill is, the more treasures that can be found. And also keep in mind that each type of Antiquarian compatible material has its own unique list of treasures. In other words you will find different treasures in Dirt than you would in Gravel.
