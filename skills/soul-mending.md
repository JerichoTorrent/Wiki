# Soul Mending

Repair tools or armor using the Soul Anvil. This anvil is an Iron Block, and should not be confused with the Vanilla Minecraft Anvil, or the Gold Block for Soulful Recombination. Place down a Soul Anvil and right-click to repair the item you're currently holding. This consumes 1 item on every use.

## Fabrication <a href="#how-does-repair-mastery-work" id="how-does-repair-mastery-work"></a>

Fabrication increases the repair amount. The extra amount repaired is influenced by your **Soul Mending** skill level.

## Soul Recombination <a href="#how-does-super-repair-work" id="how-does-super-repair-work"></a>

This is a passive ability. When repairing an item, it grants you a chance to repair an item with double effectiveness.

## Soul Fire <a href="#how-does-arcane-forging-work" id="how-does-arcane-forging-work"></a>

This passive ability allows you to repair items with a certain chance of maintaining its enchantments. The enchants may be kept at their existing levels, downgraded to a lower level, or lost entirely.
