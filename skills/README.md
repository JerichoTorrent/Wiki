# Skills

Our magic system, known as Soul Arts and by extension Soul Affinity, allows you to use your cybernetic implants to level up your abilities well beyond the Vanilla gameplay loop. You can open the Soul Arts GUI with `/skills`. For in-game information about specific skills, simply type "/" then type the skill name, for example -> `/antigravdrive`&#x20;

You can also type `/<skill name> ? <page number>` to learn even more about said skill.

Note: the descriptions of these skills have taken great inspiration from the [McMMO wiki](https://wiki.mcmmo.org), save for our custom retranslation and lore synopsis. If you want to read it directly from the source, feel free to check out their docs instead.
