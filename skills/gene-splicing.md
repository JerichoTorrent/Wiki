# Gene Splicing

Collect plants and herbs to level up your **Gene Splicing** skill.

## Terra Nova <a href="#how-does-green-terra-work" id="how-does-green-terra-work"></a>

To use this active ability, you can right-click while holding a hoe to activate Terra Nova. This gives you a chance to get 3x drops from harvesting plants. It also gives you the ability to spread life into blocks and transform them using seeds from your inventory.

## Auto Planter <a href="#how-does-green-thumb-crops-work" id="how-does-green-thumb-crops-work"></a>

Through some trickery of your implants, imbued with Soul Affinity, you can extract the energy from an item you harvest to automatically replant it, or transmute its components.

### Crops

This passive ability will automatically replant crops when harvesting. Your chance of success depends on your **Gene Splicing** skill.

### Cobble/Stone Brick/Dirt <a href="#how-does-green-thumb-cobblestone-brickdirt-work" id="how-does-green-thumb-cobblestone-brickdirt-work"></a>

This active ability allows you to turn blocks into their "plant-related" counterparts. You can do this by right-clicking a block, while holding seeds. This will consume 1 seed.

## Nutrient Paste <a href="#how-does-farmers-diet-work" id="how-does-farmers-diet-work"></a>

This passive skill increases the amount of hunger restored when eating bread, cookies, melons, mushroom soup, carrots, and potatoes.

## Artorian's Spirit <a href="#how-does-hylian-luck-work" id="how-does-hylian-luck-work"></a>

This passive ability gives you a chance to find rare items when certain blocks are broken with a sword.

## Master Terraformer <a href="#how-do-double-drops-work" id="how-do-double-drops-work"></a>

This passive ability gives players more yield from their harvests.

## Fungi Nova

This works the same way as **Auto Planter**, except for mushrooms. It automatically plants them depending on your **Gene Splicing** skill.
