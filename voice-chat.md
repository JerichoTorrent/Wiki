# Voice Chat

## Installation

To use voice chat on Torrent, install the mod Simple Voice Chat.

* From Modrinth: [https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)
* From CurseForge: [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat)

Drag it into your mods folder or install it directly with the Modrinth app, or your launcher of choice. Once installed, press "V" (the default keybind) to open the voice chat menu and configuration. Set your audio/input settings as you prefer and you're good to go! It's recommended to increase your volume input and output settings.

## How to Use Voice Chat

After confirming it's installed and working, you should see a microphone logo on your screen indicating that it's picking up your input. If you're on a gamemode where it's not working, or your microphone is not picking up, it will appear in red. To change your settings, press "V". You should now start hearing players near you who also have Simple Voice Chat, and be able to talk to them freely.
