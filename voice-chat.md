# Voice Chat

## Installation

To use voice chat on Torrent, install the mod Plasmo Voice Chat.

* From Modrinth: [https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice)
* From CurseForge: [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/plasmo-voice/files](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/plasmo-voice/files)

Drag it into your mods folder or install it directly with the Modrinth app, or your launcher of choice. Once installed, press "V" (the default keybind) to open the voice chat menu and configuration. Set your audio/input settings as you prefer and you're good to go! It's recommended to increase your volume input and output settings.

## How to Use Voice Chat

After confirming it's installed and working, you should see a microphone logo on your screen indicating that it's picking up your input. If you're on a gamemode where it's not working, or your microphone is not picking up, it will appear in red. To use groups, press "V" and navigate to group settings and make sure your sources are turned up to your preferred settings. Type `/groups create <name> <password>` to create a group.

To invite a player to your group, type `/groups invite <player>`. Now, you can communicate on all servers where Plasmo Voice is installed, from anywhere! You may want to change your activation settings from push to talk to voice, depending on how you want it to work.

Type `/groups set persistent` to make the group last between sessions.
