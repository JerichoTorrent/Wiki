# Global

### **What version(s) and edition(s) does the Network support?**

Pretty much all. You can join on Bedrock or Java, on almost any version back to 1.13, as well as console and phone. Check out this [guide](../how-to-join-on-console.md) if you're trying to join on a console and can't find a way to add a server.

### Is the server cracked?

No, nor will it ever be. I don't support piracy. Also, cracked servers usually have horrible security and potential vulnerabilities. It's a bad idea, through and through. Buy the game.

### **What mods are allowed?**

The allowed mods list can be seen in full by running `/guide` on any of our servers, or by running `!mods` in #bot-commands on the Discord server. However, an abridged list contains mini-map, mini-hud, performance mods like those that end in -ium, QuickCrafting and more. Any mod that doesn't give you a concrete gameplay advantage and/or trigger our anti-cheat to get mad at you is usually cool. However, mods/clients like Baritone, Meteor, Wurst, Toolbox, LB, and anything with combat hacks is not allowed. Furthermore, do not use anything with Jesus, click-tp, fly, nuke, or kill-aura. Use common sense here.

### **What difficulty are we playing on?**

On all servers, the difficulty is set to hard. This may turn some people off, I'm sure. Despite that, hard mode presents the most honest challenge and is the difficulty most players on the servers prefer.

### **Can I invite my friend?**

Of course. It's a public network. Invite as many people as you can.

### **How do I switch servers?**

In the hub, use the server selector in your inventory to open up a GUI and select the server you want to join. A short description of each server can be read when hovering over it. Click on the icon to join the server, or if you're on mobile, hold-press. On any of the back-end servers, use the command `/servers` to open up a menu to switch, similar to the server selector. Another option is typing out the server manually, like `/server Survival`.

### **Why can't I see the custom models on Bedrock Edition?**

This is a known limitation with resource packs. It's possible to make a Bedrock compatible resource pack, but the situation gets invariably more complex when using a resource pack manager, like we do. We hopefully will have both Java and Bedrock compatible models available in the future.

### **I keep timing out from the server. What gives?**

1. The server may be having a network issue. If that's the case, rest assured it's being fixed ASAP.
2. You may have packet loss. If you can connect to other servers just fine, you can't necessarily rule this one out. Something you can try: open up command prompt. Type `ipconfig /flushdns`, and press enter. You may also try restarting your router/modem.

### I got banned. What do I do?

If it was a temporary ban and you totally deserved it, just wait it out. If it was a permanent ban, you can appeal it in Discord using #create-a-ticket. If you come into the Discord whining in #general chat and don't make a ticket, don't be surprised if you end up losing your chance to appeal. Moderators are well trained but they are human, so if they make a mistake, please do your best to be patient with our process. We try to address tickets quickly.

If you make a ticket, explain in detail what happened and make your case. You are innocent until proven guilty, so a moderator will have to prove your punishment was justified. If your appeal is approved, you will be reinstated and the punishment will be removed, so that the escalation does not apply and punish you for longer.

### What modpack do I need to join?

No mods are necessary to join. In fact, our server software is based on Bukkit, so fabric and forge mods don't work on the server-side. Most client-side mods work just fine though. We usually don't take mod and plugin suggestions too seriously. We've been very deliberate about what content we've added and don't just go around adding random plugins for no reason.

### How do I apply for staff?

Make a ticket in #create-a-ticket in our Discord server. From there if you would like to have a more private conversation with the owner, JerichoTorrent, we can hop in a private VC. Staff applications are currently closed, but if a circumstance presents where we open them up, we will announce it to the community.

### Can you add this fabric/forge mod to the server?

No. This isn't a fabric or forge server, therefore it is incompatible with those mods. We also don't just add plugins that players suggest because often times, that player only wants it for some specific feature and isn't thinking about how that affects the game's balance or how the plugin is optimized. If you want a feature, suggest the feature, not some plugin or mod you think will enhance the server. You'd be surprised about the spaghetti code that gets popular on Spigot and CurseForge.
