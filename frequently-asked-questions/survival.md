# Survival

### **How do I teleport, get back to spawn, TPA to my friend, etc.?**

On Survival, an emphasis is placed on real-world travel and our Districts. For this reason, we've disabled most teleportation commands and replaced them with portals and NPCs. You can easily get back to spawn with `/spawn`, but that is the only actual teleportation command you can use from anywhere. To build a portal back to the hub for easy linking, use an [Access Point](../survival/teleportation-hub/access-points.md). To randomly teleport, use one of two portals. One is in the [Teleportation Hub](../survival/teleportation-hub/) and one is at Spawn Academy. Warps are disabled. To TPA, use the Teleportation Master in the second floor of the Teleportation Hub.

### **How do I make and spend money?**

Read our full Survival Economy guide [here](../survival/economy.md). In general, do [quests](../survival/quests/), sell items with `/sellgui`, [vote](../voting.md), and get creative with our systems. Spend your money in the Shopping District at coordinates 0/0 or by traveling to the Teleportation Hub and traveling out toward the T-Mart.

### **How do I start the main quest?**

Go to spawn (using `/spawn` or the [Teleportation Hub](../survival/teleportation-hub/)) and start the quest BitTorrent Peer-to-Peer Protocol with the Torrent Recruiter. He will take you to the Quest Emporium (near 0/0) which is a hub of sorts. After getting your lay of the land with the quest Travelin' Torrent, given to you by the Torrent Contractor, you will be ready to start the main quest. In the back room of the Quest Emporium is the NPC Direnni. Talk to him to start the 1st quest, An Odd Request.

### **Can I PvP?**

PvP is by consent only on Survival. You can't just go around killing players, or you may end up in [court](../survival/district-court.md), jail, or banned. I'm sure someone would be willing to PvP you, but if you are looking for a PvP server, check out [Lifesteal](broken-reference).

### Where are all the elytras?

When you play on a Survival server with one long-running map like ours, elytras tend to be hard to come by. For this reason, every couple of months we reset the outer end islands. The end also has custom terrain, but that doesn't mean anything has changed about default end city spawns. You'll still be able to find the ships and elytras like normal. However, using a custom developed plugin by Nouish, you can only get 2 elytras per 2 week period to prevent hoarding.

The ONLY place where you can buy elytras is in the Auction House in the Shopping District at 44/63/33.

### It keeps saying my villager is disabled. How do I fix it?

If you try to make a trading villager, you must disable it first. Disable the villager by naming it "Bonk" (case sensitive.) It will not use the nametag. To unbonk the villager, simply name it anything else to move it or make it do something else. Farming villagers will still work when disabled, as will iron farm villagers.
