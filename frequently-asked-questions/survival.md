# Survival

### **How do I teleport, get back to spawn, TPA to my friend, etc.?**

On Survival, an emphasis is placed on real-world travel and our Districts. For this reason, we've disabled most teleportation commands and replaced them with NPCs. You can easily get back to spawn with `/spawn`, then use the Warp Menu to travel around the server. Spawn is a central hub for all traveling.

### **How do I make and spend money?**

Read our full Survival Economy guide [here](../survival/economy.md). In general, do quests, sell items with `/sellgui`, [vote](../voting.md), and get creative with our systems. Spend your money in the Shopping District at coordinates 0/0 or by traveling to the Shopping District and traveling out toward the T-Mart.

### **How do I start the main quest?**

Quests are currently being overhauled! Stay tuned!

### **Can I PvP?**

PvP is by consent only on Survival, by typing `/pvp`. You can't just go around killing players, or you may end up in [court](../survival/district-court.md), jail, or banned. I'm sure someone would be willing to PvP you, but if you are looking for a PvP server, check out [Lifesteal](broken-reference).

### Where are all the elytras?

When you play on a Survival server with one long-running map like ours, elytras tend to be hard to come by. For this reason, every couple of months we reset the outer end islands. The end also has custom terrain, but that doesn't mean anything has changed about default end city spawns. You'll still be able to find the ships and elytras like normal. However, using a custom developed plugin by Nouish, you can only get 2 elytras per 2 week period to prevent hoarding.

The ONLY place where you can buy elytras is in the Auction House in the Shopping District at 44/63/33.

### How do I get back to my claim?

Sleep in a bed to set your spawn. To return to the bed, use the bed portal in the Teleportation Hub.

### Can I build a shop?

To build a shop in the Shopping District, first create a ticket in our Discord or ask an online moderator for help if they are available (don't pester them.) Second, provide your plan for your shop, whether that be a screenshot from a creative world, a showcase of your plot on our creative server, a drawing, or a detailed description of your shop idea. If approved, a moderator will give you a subclaim in the Shopping District to build it, as well as a permit.
