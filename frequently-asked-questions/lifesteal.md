# Lifesteal

### **Is X-ray allowed?**

No.

### How do I get more hearts?

[Craft them](../lifesteal/introduction.md), fight the Watchman [boss](../lifesteal/bosses.md), buy a [heart crate key](https://torrent.tebex.io/package/6290037), or kill players.

### How long do I get death banned when I lose all my hearts?

1 day.

### How many hearts do I respawn with if I get death banned?

You will respawn with 5 hearts if your death ban expires, or if you get revived by the revive beacon

### **Can I grief, steal items from players, and socially engineer them into giving me their base coordinates so I can grief them?**

Yes.

### **How do I get to the major** [**Structures**](../lifesteal/structures/)**?**

Follow the paths, or check out the [map](https://map.torrentsmp.com), where it is marked with map markers.

### How often do the loot chests regenerate?

Once daily per player for all structures.

### How often do the bosses spawn?

Some [bosses](../lifesteal/bosses.md) have different spawning rules than others. Some bosses will instantly respawn after being killed. Mini-bosses like the Hollowed Prince respawn once an hour. Most main bosses like King Jericho respawn once daily if killed (good luck with that.) Yes, you have the same chance of getting their drops each time you kill them.

### How long will Season 1 last?

Likely, 5 months. That is usually around how long it takes for people to start getting extremely OP with kits, skills, and money. As we wind down to the end of Season 1, we'll start giving sneak peaks about Season 2, which we already have EPIC plans for. The last day of Season 1, which we project will be October 31st (ooh spooky,) we will have a hardcore anarchy day. Essentially, all world protections will be turned off and you can grief spawn. You will also only have one life left. The last man standing at the end of the day wins an exclusive rank for Season 2! We will plan to launch Season 2 the very next morning, so be ready.

### When will X boss respawn?

I don't know. There are no placeholders I can use to determine when it will next spawn. You will have to check and see when it was last killed.

### How often is KoTH?

King of the Hill runs every 2 hours.
