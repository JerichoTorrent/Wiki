# Lifesteal

### **Is X-ray allowed?**

No.

### How do I get more hearts?

[Craft them](../lifesteal/introduction.md), buy a [heart crate key](https://torrent.tebex.io/package/6290037), or kill players.

### How long do I get death banned when I lose all my hearts?

1 day.

### How many hearts do I respawn with if I get death banned?

You will respawn with 5 hearts if your death ban expires, or if you get revived by the revive beacon

### **Can I grief, steal items from players, and socially engineer them into giving me their base coordinates so I can grief them?**

Yes.

### When does Season 2 launch?

November 2nd, 2024.

### How often are key-alls in Season 2?

Rare key-alls will take place every 3 hours during Season 2.

### How often is KoTH?

King of the Hill runs every 2 hours.

### What's up with the percentage value when reporting players?

The honor value (integer) represents the total honor a player has, either positive or negative. For various reasons it's also easier to express it as a percentage, so in the GUI that is how it shows up. Every 2 honor points raises or lowers the percentage by 1. 0% means -100 honor, while 100% means +100 honor.

### When will the guild system be introduced?

Guilds will likely be implemented around the 1 month mark of Season 2. This should give players enough time to build up honor in either direction to join one of the two guilds. For now, honor is a measure of a player's character.
