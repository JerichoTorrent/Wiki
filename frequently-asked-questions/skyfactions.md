# SkyFactions

### Will SkyFactions have seasons?

No. It will be one long running season, with no plans to reset.

### How do I earn gems?

Conduct raids. You wager 1 gem to start the raid, with a chance to net 2 more gems if you win the raid. You can also trade gems with other players or factions.

### My Lord betrayed me/deleted the faction!

Tough luck. The risk you take when joining a faction is having a tyrannical Lord. You can overthrow the Lord by having a civil war.

### Can islands be griefed?

Yes and no. Islands cannot be griefed (blocks cannot be broken,) but containers can be raided and defenses destroyed. The only way to keep your island completely safe is to upgrade it as much as possible.

### Can a friend help me build on my island?

No, only factions can collaborate on a single island. Your friend can visit you with `/island visit <player>`, but they cannot break or place blocks, nor raid containers.
