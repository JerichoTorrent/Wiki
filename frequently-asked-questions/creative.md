# Creative

### **How do I get permission to claim more than 1 plot?**

Earn Builder rank. This rank is given to exceptional members of our server network. Display your building abilities, be active, and be a part of the community. Builders unlock plots in creative mode as well as access to the Torrent lounge in the hub.

You can also purchase a plot from our [webstore](https://torrent.tebex.io).

### **How do I claim a plot?**

In the world you spawn in, Artoria, you can simply double press the spacebar to fly. Then, fly out into the world and find an unclaimed plot. You will know it's not claimed if no title pops up on your screen indicating the owner and plot number. Then, type `/plot claim`. You will know you did it right if you are teleported to the origin point of the plot and a title pops up on your screen. You can set your home there with `/plot sethome`.

### **How do I build in a plot with my friend?**

Either you or your friend needs to claim a plot. Then, run the command `/plot trust <player>`.

### **How do I claim bigger plots?**

Buy plot tokens in our [webstore](https://torrent.tebex.io/category/creative-plots).

### **Why is it lagging?**

Creative servers are extremely hard to run. People try to hack them all the time with all kinds of nonsense. I have found many lag machines. I don't want to limit redstone because people mainly use this server to test builds, and especially redstone, so we just have to go remove them and ban people. For that reason, if you build a lag machine, you will get banned on the whole network. If you join the server and it's completely unplayable, report the issue in Discord and come back when it's fixed. Nothing much more we can do about it.

### Why did my plot get deleted?

Two possible reasons:\
1\. You misused your plot to spawn NBT items, create offensive structures, or build a lag machine.\
2\. You claimed your plot and didn't build a single thing for months doing nothing but taking up space.\
The first plot in Creative is free; don't misuse it or you will lose it.
